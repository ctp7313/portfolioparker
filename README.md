            ## Description

            Updated HTML/CSS portfolio to React. Added components for projects to display from a JSON and routing to various pages. GH Pages continues to have issues with React apps and following support documentation to a T (and Stack Overflow) has resulted in just the front page showing up. Continuing development.
